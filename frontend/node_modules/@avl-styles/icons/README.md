# AVL Icons

### Use styled FontAwesome Icons
Use the 'fa' CSS classes to use FontAwesome icons. Note that FA takes the foreground color of the font, so if it is used together with text it has the same color.
```html
<i class="fa fa-bars fa-4x" aria-hidden="true"></i>
```

### Use AVL Icon Library
Onle some selected icons are currently served. 
> We work on a fully automated way to get all icons into this library.
```html
<div class="icon_product_puma avl-2x">
```
